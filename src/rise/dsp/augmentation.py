"""Contrastive augmentations for pitch contours.

SimCLR needs a view of a *svara* that a human would still call the same *svara*.
The augmentations below are therefore modelled on the natural variability of
performance rather than on generic time-series noise: a singer takes a little
longer or a little less time over an ornament (temporal resizing), speeds up and
slows down within it (localised time warping), and drifts slightly in pitch
(magnitude warping).
