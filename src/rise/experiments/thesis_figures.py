r"""Regenerate the illustrative figures of the thesis from the corpora.

The result figures — the confusion matrices, the UMAP projection and the phrase-wise
average precision — are produced by the experiments that compute them, because they
depend on trained models. The three figures here illustrate the data itself and can
be drawn at any time.

Each is drawn against the caption it is placed with in the thesis, including the
width its ``\includegraphics`` gives it, so that the figure needs no rescaling and
its type comes out at the intended size on the page.

DESCRIPTION = "Draw the illustrative figures of the thesis from the corpora"

#: Shortest usable rendition, in frames, for the variants figure.
MIN_RENDITION_FRAMES = 20

#: Widest excursion, in cents, a single *svara* is taken to span. *Gamaka* moves a
#: *svara* by a few *svarasthānas*, not by a fifth; a contour wider than this is an
#: octave error from the pitch tracker rather than an ornament, and picking it would
#: illustrate the tracker instead of the music.
MAX_RENDITION_RANGE_CENTS = 700

#: Recording whose beat grid illustrates how plausible *svara* boundaries are drawn.
#: A *khaṇḍa* cycle of five beats at 173 BPM, so the ten-second window the figure shows
#: holds six complete cycles.
BEAT_GRID_RECORDING = "13026"

#: Audio the beat grid falls back to when the CMR audio is not in the cache. The CMR
#: audio is licensed rather than redistributable, so it is not kept in the repository;
#: drop it into ``.cache`` and the figure picks it up on its own.
BEAT_GRID_YOUTUBE = "yqKoAt5a-k0"

#: Beats to a *tāḷa* cycle in the fallback performance — *rūpaka*, three to a cycle,
#: the same cycle length the CMR annotations of :data:`BEAT_GRID_RECORDING` carry.
BEAT_GRID_CYCLE = 3

#: The excerpt the pitch-track figure is drawn from: *rāga* Kalyāṇi as performed by
#: Ramakrishna Murthy, from the *ma* at 33.47 s to the *pa* ending at 37.07 s. Pinned
#: rather than searched for, so that the figure reproduces the one in the thesis
#: exactly; the number of realisations the caption claims is checked, not assumed.
PITCH_TRACK_PERFORMER = "ramakrishnamurthy"
PITCH_TRACK_WINDOW = (33.47, 37.07)
